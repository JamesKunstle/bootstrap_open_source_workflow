# Get started with Version Control and git Workflow!

This project (originally authored by Lance Galletti for Boston University CS506) intends to provide a one-shot introduction to contributing to GitHub and open source projects. 

Those who follow the curriculum of this project will first be given the background to understand how to use git on the command line, including a preamble discussing how to setup ones machine to communicate with GitHub. They will then put this understanding to the test in a fun, interactive city-building exercise that uses pull-request-based contribution.


## Usage

```bash
# to go through git exercises
$cd 00-git
$cd exercises
$less <specific lesson>.md

# to go through the python city exercise
$cd 01-python
# make some changes to the city print functions,
# then see the output by running the following:
$python3 city.py
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
